# Machine Learning model to predict house price using linear regression
Predicting house prices using linear regression is a common machine learning task in the field of real estate and finance. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, house prices) and one or more independent variables (features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, etc.). In this detailed guide, I'll walk you through the steps to build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices.
